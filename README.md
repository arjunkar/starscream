A toy version of NVIDIA's `Megatron` [project](https://github.com/nvidia/megatron-lm).
Specifically, multiprocessing and distributed techniques are used to implement tensor model, pipeline model, and data parallelism.
These techniques are informed by several NVIDIA research articles ([1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08053), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04473), and [3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05198)).
